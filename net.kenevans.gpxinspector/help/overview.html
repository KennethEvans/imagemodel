<h1 align="center">GPX Inspector</h1>
<p>GPX Inspector is an application that allows you to view and manage GPX files.  Its main contribution is to let you see your tracks, routes, and waypoints in Google Earth. It is is based on <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and requires Java to be installed. You shlould be able to get Java <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">here</a>. </p>
<p> The main part of the interface is a tree view, which consists of all the files you have loaded and the tracks, routes, and waypoints in them. You can expand or contract the tree, and other options are available by right clicking a tree item. You can drag and drop GPX files to the tree view. You can select all visible items in the tree with Ctrl-A.</p>
